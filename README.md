# Awesome Photonic Design Automation [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)


The goal of Photonics Design Automation is to use algorithmic methods (such as graph theory, optimization methods, statistics, and machine learning) to ease human burden when designing a photonics chip. Here the repo contains many useful references related to photnoics circuits from various perspectives, such as theory, modeling, application. I am hoping to inspire readers to excavate and then address underlying design problems using algorithms. Together, we will push design automation being a necessary compnonent in the photonic design flow and help its design easier than ever.

## Electromagnetic (EM) Basics

- [John D. Jackson, 'Classical Electrodynamics'](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Classical+Electrodynamics%2C+3rd+Edition-p-9780471309321) 
    - A classical textbook in EM. It is very comprehensive and math dense. It is more appropriate to readers who have background in EM.

- [David J. Griffiths, 'Introduction to Electrodynamics'](https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/introduction-to-electrodynamics/3AB220820DBB628E5A43D52C4B011ED4#overview)
    - A classical textbook in EM. Compared to Jackson's, Griffiths's is more beginner friendly. It has many graphical illustrations and the math derivation is step by step. However, a few advanced topics are not covered (e.g., Green functions).

- [David H. Staelin, Ann Morgenthaler, and Jin Au Kong 'Electromagnetic Waves'](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Staelin-Electromagnetic-Waves/PGM63919.html)
    - A Classical textbook in EM. Jackson's and Griffiths's start from electrostatics, while this book directly starts from electrodynamics. In this sense, it is more suitable if you are looking for a book 'more cut to the point'.

## Electronic-Photonic Co-simulation

To me, this topic is a very important one, yet at a very immature stage. The futuer of circuits in my understanding will be a mixture of electronics and photonics on the same chip. Thus, electronic and photonic co-simulation is of huge interest. There are a few works exploring along this direction; even a commerical product, [OptiSpice](https://optiwave.com/optispice-overview/), is now available. However, personally, I feel that the current paradigm for co-simulation is far from satisfying, while tremendous efforts should be devoted to this topic. Of course, since {E,H} for photonics and {I,V} for electronics locate at two different abstract physical level, this topic won't be easy.
